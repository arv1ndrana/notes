#### notes:

Happiness does not mean smiling all the time. Happiness means thinking that life is good both with your life and in your life.

People think that happiness means experiencing positive emotions all the time. But, it is just a misconception of our society.

While, negative emotions are generally bad, they have an evolutionary reasons to exist.

This is why we should not try to suppress our negative emotions but, to embrace them as part of our life.

Subjective Well being is scientific term for happiness level.

The best way to measure someone's happiness level is to just ask them.

Their answer can help us determine their happiness level just as accurately as other scientific methods.

This means that scientifically speaking self reporting works to measure someone's happiness level.

Social media are meant to be used actively.

We have to post content from our sides in order to not effect our happiness.

We have to like, share, and comment on other's post.

This is the healthy way to use social media.
